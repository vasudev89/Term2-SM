# Amita Ma'am: Discussion on 20/11/2020

## Business Level Strategy

### Game Theory
- You cannot take from a game more than you bring to it
- Asses the entire value of the game
- Remove a player and again the assess the value
- Difference is the value of the player

- Rule Based Games
- Every action has an opposite reaction (Equal or Unequal)

- Freewheeling Games
- Card Matching Game
	- Ma'am has all red cards
	- 26 others have 1 black card each
	- Match = 100
	- Total Value = 2600
	- If I am removed, 1 pair can't be matched. Thus value = 100
	- If Ma'am is removed, value = 0

##### Co-opetition
	- Combination of competition and Cooperation
	- Try to move from a win lose to a win win situation

##### The Game of Business

### Value Net
- Customers and Suppliers have moved to the vertical axis
- Transactions occur b/w them
- Horizontal axis has only interactions, no transactions:
	- Substitutors:
		- Rivals, New Entrants, Substitutes, Those firms which are not part of the industry 
		- Customers can buy from them in case of non-availability
			- Coke and Pepsi
		- Suppliers(Upstream) may sell their resources to them in case they wish to
	- Complementors:
		- Players from whom customers buy complementary products or to whom suppliers may sell complementary resources
		- Spicejet and Indigo
		- All airlines buy from Airbus causing R&D expense to be distributed
		- At upstream they are Complementors. Downstream they are Substitutors.

#### PARTS FRAMEWORK
- Players: Represented on Value Net
	- Substitutors, Complementors, Customers and Suppliers
	- Complementors: Refer to Complementors from previous point
