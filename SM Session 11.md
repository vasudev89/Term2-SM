# Amita Ma'am: Discussion on 20/11/2020

## Business Level Strategy

### Game Theory
- You cannot take from a game more than you bring to it
- Asses the entire value of the game
- Remove a player and again the assess the value
- Difference is the value of the player

- Rule Based Games
- Every action has an opposite reaction (Equal or Unequal)

- Freewheeling Games
- Card Matching Game
	- Ma'am has all red cards
	- 26 others have 1 black card each
	- Match = 100
	- Total Value = 2600
	- If I am removed, 1 pair can't be matched. Thus value = 100
	- If Ma'am is removed, value = 0

##### Co-opetition
	- Combination of competition and Cooperation
	- Try to move from a win lose to a win win situation

##### The Game of Business

### Value Net
- Customers and Suppliers have moved to the vertical axis
- Transactions occur b/w them
- Horizontal axis has only interactions, no transactions:
	- Substitutors(Downstream):
		- Loss can occur(-ive effect)
		- Rivals, New Entrants, Substitutes, Those firms which are not part of the industry 
		- Customers can buy from them in case of non-availability
			- Coke and Pepsi
		- Suppliers(Upstream) may sell their resources to them in case they wish to
	- Complementors(Upstream):
		- Facilitate sale of products(+ive effect)
		- Players from whom customers buy complementary products or to whom suppliers may sell complementary resources
		- Spicejet and Indigo
		- All airlines buy from Airbus causing R&D expense to be distributed
		- At upstream they are Complementors. Downstream they are Substitutors.

#### PARTS FRAMEWORK
- Players: Represented on Value Net
	- Substitutors, Complementors, Customers and Suppliers
	- Complementors: Refer to Complementors from previous point 

#### Changing the Game
- Draw Value
- Identify Players

#### Changing the Players
- Pay me to play
	- Suppliers: Holland Sweeteners & Neutra Sweet(70% Gross Margin)
	- Coke and Pepsi were in bitter competition
	- Neutra Sweet cannot be let go immediately
- Cheap Complements
	- Hardware/Software
	- Razor and Blades

#### Changing the Added Value
- Raise your added value
	- Over Capacity of Airlines
	- Don't indulge in Price Wars at the cost of customer suffering
- Lower Added Value of others
	- Minetonka bought capacity
- Protecting added value is as imp as building it

#### Changing Rules
- Give structure to the game
- Revise or come up with new ones: Canon Case
- Some rules:
	- One Price to all -> Entry at lower price - Judo Strategy(Big Player should let the small player enter. Too costly to fight. Small Player may also protect the turf in his space.)
		- Incumbent can match price or give up share
	- Meet competition clause
		- Lowest = variable cost
		- L1 Tenders
			- New supplier comes with lowest bid
			- Assured of quality of previous suppliers
			- Give a chance to the previous players to meet the new rates

#### Changing the Tactics
- Change the way players percieve uncertainty -> Lift the fog or thicken it
- 2 newspapers in the US
- 1 increase price: Lost market share
- the other didn't instead it got the lost market share of the first
- 1st created a fog: reduced the price significantly in a few states. Claimed that it would do this in all states
- 2nd company had to increase the price eventually
