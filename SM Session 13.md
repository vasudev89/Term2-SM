## Corporate Strategy
- 2 Ques for CEOs
	- What Businesses should the company own and why
	- What kind of org structure should be there in the org for superior performance
- Forms of Diversification - Vertical, Horizontal and Global
- Means of Diversification - Organic, Strat Alliance, M&A
- Motives for Diversification
- Growth through Adjacency Strategies

## Why do firms diversify
- When their objects can no longer be met by within product scope defined by expansion
- Even if attractive expansion opportunities are available and past objectives are being met, firms diversify because retained cash exceeds the total expansion
- When diversification opportunities promise greater profitability than expansion opportunity
- When the available info is not reliable enough to permit a conclusive comparison b/w expansion and diversification
- Only when mission and product change it is termed diversification, otherwise it is expansion

## Diversification Types
- Products in terms of tech
	- Related Tech
	- Unrelated Tech
- Customers in terms of their type
	- Same Type
	- Firm is its own customer
	- Similar Type
	- New Type

- Refer to Types of Diversification in PPT

- Related Tech - Same Type
	- Motor Bike and Lawn Mower
		- Both have a motor
		- Similar customer with related tech
		- Horizontal Diversification or Integration
- Unrelated Tech - Same Type
	- Concentric Diversification
		- Either with similar customer the tech may be related or unrelated

## Forms of Diversification/Expansion

## Tests
- Industry Attractiveness
	- ISA
- Cost of Entry:
	- Use Porter's Five Forces Model(Preceded by PESTEL)
	- Cost to overcome entry barriers and after overcoming would we still be profitable
- Better Off Test:
	- Horizontal Diversification
		- Economies of Scope
			- C(Y1,Y2) < C(Y1,0) + C(0,Y2)
		- Cross Selling
			- R(Y1,Y2) > R(Y1,0) + R(0,Y2)
	- Vertical Integration
		- Relationship Specific Investments
			- I need the product, I may or may not get it, Do not buy it but own it instead
		- Downstream free-riding
			- Setup own or go with ready-made
		- Double marginalization
			- If you had an outlet downstream, double markup on wholesale price may lead to product not being sold

- Note: Porter's cannot be done without PESTEL

## Levels of Diversification
- Low Levels of Diversification
	- Single Business => >95% Rev from a single business
	- Dominant Business => 70-95% Rev from single business
- Moderate to High Levels of Diversification
	- Related Constrained => <70% Rev from dominant business. All businesses share product, tech and distribution links
	- Related Linked => <70% Rev from dominant business. Limits links b/w businesses
- Very High Level of Diversification
	- Unrelated => <70% Rev from dominant business. No common links b/w businesses
