- __40% Revenue increase each year__
- Xerox felt invincible

### Canon: Camera Company from Japan
- Late 1960s: Entered the business as a rival
- __Concerns of Skeptics__:
	- 1/10th the size of Xerox
	- No direct sales or service organization to reach the market
	- No Process Technology: Xerox had 500 patents for its PPC(Plain Paper Copier) process

- Yet, 2 decades later 
	- $5 billion in revenues
	- Second largest player in the business
	- Surpassed Xerox in the number of units sold
	- Reason was its mission: synergistic management of technological capabilities + combining the full measure of Canon's know how in Fine Optics, Electronics, Fine Chemicals, and Precision Mechanics

## Xerox History
- Year: 1948
- Carlson: inventor of electrostatic process => transfer images from 1 paper to another
- 2 new developments:
	- CPC(Coated Paper Copier): Zinc Oxide Coated Paper
	- PPC(Plain Paper Copier): transferred image from 1 paper directly to another by using charged particles

- Dry Toner preferred in both technologies

## Strategic Advantages

- PPC: Monopoly of Xerox(Protected by 500 Patents)
	- Cheaper paper required
	- Did not fade under heat or light
	- Faster than CPC
	- Higher volumes: Could print multiple units at a time

- Customer base: B2B Clientele
	- PPC a costly machine
	- Businesses could afford
	- Centralized copying highly attractive
	- M/cs leased rather than sold to businesses
	- Revenue Basis: Number of copies made by a business

- International Orientation(Geographic Expansion):
	- 1956: Ventured with Rank Org Ltd in the UK to form Rank Xerox
	- 1962: Rank Xerox became a 50% partner in Fuji to form Fuji Xerox to sell copiers in Japan
	- Primary Markets: US, Europe, and Japan

- Investment in Technology and Manufacturing:
	- Spent $100 Million on R&D annually

## Canon History
- Founded in Year 1933 to compete with German Leica. Produced 35mm camera
- WW2: optics expertize to produce an X ray machine for Japanese Military
- Mid 1950s: Largest Camera manufacturer in the world
- Developed 8mm camera, tv lenses and micrographic eq
- __Diversification__: very important to Canon

<br>

- Year: 1962
- New products R&D setup
- Intent: __Explore__ 
	- Copy m/cs: <h4> PPC research initiated </h4>
	- Auto focus cameras
	- Strobe integrated cameras
	- Home VCRs
	- Electronic calculators

- First Target Product: Calculator => difficult since it required Canon to understand microelectronics
- President: Tekeshi Mitarai - "Too difficult and Risky"

- Year: 1964
- Canola 130 released. World's first 10 key numeric pad calculator

### Diversification didn't always succeed
**Failure**
- Year 1959
- Synchroreader - RW ops on a piece of paper coated with mag material
- Good desing but not patented => similar firm introduced a similar product at half price

### Move into copiers:
-
