- __40% Revenue increase each year__
- Xerox felt invincible

### Canon: Camera Company from Japan
- Late 1960s: Entered the business as a rival
- __Concerns of Skeptics__:
	- 1/10th the size of Xerox
	- No direct sales or service organization to reach the market
	- No Process Technology: Xerox had 500 patents for its PPC(Plain Paper Copier) process

- Yet, 2 decades later 
	- $5 billion in revenues
	- Second largest player in the business
	- Surpassed Xerox in the number of units sold
	- Reason was its mission: synergistic management of technological capabilities + combining the full measure of Canon's know how in Fine Optics, Electronics, Fine Chemicals, and Precision Mechanics

## Xerox History
- Year: 1948
- Carlson: inventor of electrostatic process => transfer images from 1 paper to another
- 2 new developments:
	- CPC(Coated Paper Copier): Zinc Oxide Coated Paper
	- PPC(Plain Paper Copier): transferred image from 1 paper directly to another by using charged particles

- Dry Toner preferred in both technologies

## Strategic Advantages

- PPC: Monopoly of Xerox(Protected by 500 Patents)
	- Cheaper paper required
	- Did not fade under heat or light
	- Faster than CPC
	- Higher volumes: Could print multiple units at a time

- Customer base: B2B Clientele
	- PPC a costly machine
	- Businesses could afford
	- Centralized copying highly attractive
	- M/cs leased rather than sold to businesses
	- Revenue Basis: Number of copies made by a business

- International Orientation(Geographic Expansion):
	- 1956: Ventured with Rank Org Ltd in the UK to form Rank Xerox
	- 1962: Rank Xerox became a 50% partner in Fuji to form Fuji Xerox to sell copiers in Japan
	- Primary Markets: US, Europe, and Japan

- Investment in Technology and Manufacturing:
	- Spent $100 Million on R&D annually

## Canon History
- Founded in Year 1933 to compete with German Leica. Produced 35mm camera
- WW2: optics expertize to produce an X ray machine for Japanese Military
- Mid 1950s: Largest Camera manufacturer in the world
- Developed 8mm camera, tv lenses and micrographic eq
- __Diversification__: very important to Canon

<br>

- Year: 1962
- New products R&D setup
- Intent: __Explore__ 
	- Copy m/cs - __PPC research initiated__
		- <h5>X</h5>
		- PPC protected by patents by Xerox
		- Speed + Economy + Quality -> reason why Canon wanted to step into the market
	- Auto focus cameras
	- Strobe integrated cameras
	- Home VCRs
	- Electronic calculators

- First Target Product: Calculator => difficult since it required Canon to understand microelectronics
- President: Tekeshi Mitarai - "Too difficult and Risky"

- Year: 1964
- Canola 130 released. World's first 10 key numeric pad calculator

### Diversification didn't always succeed
**Failure**
- Year 1959
- Synchroreader - RW ops on a piece of paper coated with mag material
- Good desing but not patented => similar firm introduced a similar product at half price

### Move into copiers:
- __Refer X in document__
- Year: 1965
- Entered with CPC - Confax 1000
- Marketed only in Japan

### Success
- Year: 1968
- NP(New Process) accounced by Canon
- Immediately protected by 500 Patents
- NP1100 - First M/C - introduced in 1970
	- 10 copies a min
	- Dry toner
	- 2 years later Canon entered the overseas market(except North America)

- Year: 1972
- NPL7 introduced
	- Liquid Toner
	- Eliminated complex fusing technology
	- More economical, compact, and reliable
	- Same or better quality of copies
	- Sold licensing to firms: earned revenues of $32 mill between 1975 and 1982
	- Influence of Technology leveraged in the 70s
		- Year: 1973
		- Added color 
		- Year: 1975
		- Added laser beam printing
		- Year: 1978
		- High volume copier pitted against Xerox 9200
		- Year 1979
		- NP200 introduced - Most economical and productive copier available
		- Year: 1982
		- Copiers surpassed cameras as the company's largest revenue generator

### Personal Copier
- Period: Late 1970s
- AE-1 : Camera - compact SLR camera - First camera to use microelectronics
- Wanted similar success with PPCs
- Planned to target the copier to firms requiring low volume "value for money" copiers
- Keep it as a personal side desk machine - good for decentralization in offices
- Engineering and R&D took up the challenge
- 1 challenge: Specific Paper Size used in 60% of Japanese Market. Standardized to Letter size for international sale
- 3 years later -> __Success__
	- Smallest, Lightest copier ever made
	- Decentralized
	- PC: Personal Copier had beed created
	- Patent Law used to protect the technology

# Canon Overview

### Long term Startegy: Become a Premier company
- Strengths: Tech Inovations + MKt Expertise + Low Cost Quality Manu.
- Common Approach: Extensive outsourcing and focused internal development

### Tech
- Decentralized R&D: Each Product Division(PD) has its own R&D
- Each PD R&D tasked with designing and developing short to medium= term products
- Developed by cross fucntional teams
- Managed by R&D HQ group





# Amita Ma'am: Discussion on 18/11/2020
- Strategic Intent
	- Xerox
	- Canon used a Resource Based View

## Assets
	- Tangible
	- Intangible
	- Capabilities
		- Assets * Capailities = Competence
		- Tech is a resource
		- Patent: if it makes tech a VRIO then the patent is a resource


## Jam board
	- Value Chain Dimensions
		- Tech
			- 500 patents
			- PPC tech
			- R & D 10 times the rev of most of market players
			- Decentralized R&D
		- Mkt
			- 93% market share
			- Brand synonymous with copying
			- Sales & Service N/w
			- Lease strategy - entry barrier
			- JV to expand
			- Local mkt customization
			- Sepcific Segment
		- Ops
			- Large sized plants - Economies of Scale 	
			- Product Commonality
		- Infra
			- International Presence
		- HRM
			- Work Cultre

## VRIO
- VRIO is an initialism for the four question framework asked about a resource or capability to determine its competitive potential: the question of Value, the question of Rarity, the question of Imitability (Ease/Difficulty to Imitate), and the question of Organization (ability to exploit the resource or capability).

	- The Question of Value: "Is the firm able to exploit an opportunity or neutralize an external threat with the resource/capability?"
	- The Question of Rarity: "Is control of the resource/capability in the hands of a relative few?"
	- The Question of Imitability: "Is it difficult to imitate, and will there be significant cost disadvantage to a firm trying to obtain, develop, or duplicate the resource/capability?"
	- The Question of Organization: "Is the firm organized, ready, and able to exploit the resource/capability?" "Is the firm organized to capture value?"

## Is Market Share a resource?
- if it's VRIO then it's a resource

## Question: What resource did Canon's use in overcoming Xerox's?
-
